## This Program is designed to ensure we don't undercut our parent company TTI on pricing regarding the customer part numbers we both have

The program looks at CPN in the commodity quotes and compares them to our most resent queries 'Backlog', and 'Sales History'

1. Select your customer CPN file 
2. Select your latest contract for that customer 
3. Select you Backlog file 
4. Select your Sales history file for that customer 
5. Save your final file


## If the CPN is in both queries we just need to pull the backlog data
